    "\n",
    "Python was born in the late 1980s. Its creator, [Guido van\n",

    "the British comedy \"Monty Python's Flying Circus.\" His goal was to\n",

    "plain English.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a _general-purpose_ language, which means that you\n",

    "websites, analyzing sounds, creating games, and of course _engineering\n",
    "computations_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an _interpreted_ language. This means that you can write\n",
    "Python commands and the computer can execute those instructions\n",
    "directly. Other programming languages—like C, C++ and Fortran—require a\n",

    "For this lesson, you should open a blank\n",
