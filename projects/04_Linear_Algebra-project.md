# CompMech04-Linear Algebra Project
## Practical Linear Algebra for Finite Element Analysis

+++

In this project we will perform a linear-elastic finite element analysis (FEA) on a support structure made of 11 beams that are riveted in 7 locations to create a truss as shown in the image below. 

![Mesh image of truss](../images/mesh.png)

+++

The triangular truss shown above can be modeled using a [direct stiffness method [1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_stiffness_method), that is detailed in the [extra-FEA_material](./extra-FEA_material.ipynb) notebook. The end result of converting this structure to a FE model. Is that each joint, labeled $n~1-7$, short for _node 1-7_ can move in the x- and y-directions, but causes a force modeled with Hooke's law. Each beam labeled $el~1-11$, short for _element 1-11_, contributes to the stiffness of the structure. We have 14 equations where the sum of the components of forces = 0, represented by the equation

$\mathbf{F-Ku}=\mathbf{0}$

Where, $\mathbf{F}$ are externally applied forces, $\mathbf{u}$ are x- and y- displacements of nodes, and $\mathbf{K}$ is the stiffness matrix given in `fea_arrays.npz` as `K`, shown below

_note: the array shown is 1000x(`K`). You can use units of MPa (N/mm^2), N, and mm. The array `K` is in 1/mm_

$\mathbf{K}=EA*$

In this project we are solving the problem, $\mathbf{F}=\mathbf{Ku}$, where $\mathbf{F}$ is measured in Newtons, $\mathbf{K}$ `=E*A*K` is the stiffness in N/mm, `E` is Young's modulus measured in MPa (N/mm^2), and `A` is the cross-sectional area of the beam measured in mm^2. 

There are three constraints on the motion of the joints:

i. node 1 displacement in the x-direction is 0 = `u[0]`

ii. node 1 displacement in the y-direction is 0 = `u[1]`

iii. node 7 displacement in the y-direction is 0 = `u[13]`

We can satisfy these constraints by leaving out the first, second, and last rows and columns from our linear algebra description.

### 1. Calculate the condition of `K` and the condition of `K[2:13,2:13]`. 

a. What error would you expect when you solve for `u` in `K*u = F`? 

b. Why is the condition of `K` so large? __The problem is underconstrained. It describes stiffness of structure, but not the BC's. So, we end up with sumF=0 and -sumF=0__

c. What error would you expect when you solve for `u[2:13]` in `K[2:13,2:13]*u=F[2:13]`

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(np.linalg.cond(K))
print(np.linalg.cond(K[2:13,2:13]))

print('expected error in x=solve(K,b) is {}'.format(10**(16-16)))
print('expected error in x=solve(K[2:13,2:13],b) is {}'.format(10**(2-16)))
```

### 2. Apply a 300-N downward force to the central top node (n 4)

a. Create the LU matrix for K[2:13,2:13]

b. Use cross-sectional area of $0.1~mm^2$ and steel and almuminum moduli, $E=200~GPa~and~E=70~GPa,$ respectively. Solve the forward and backward substitution methods for 

* $\mathbf{Ly}=\mathbf{F}\frac{1}{EA}$

* $\mathbf{Uu}=\mathbf{y}$

_your array `F` is zeros, except for `F[5]=-300`, to create a -300 N load at node 4._

c. Plug in the values for $\mathbf{u}$ into the full equation, $\mathbf{Ku}=\mathbf{F}$, to solve for the reaction forces

d. Create a plot of the undeformed and deformed structure with the displacements and forces plotted as vectors (via `quiver`). Your result for aluminum should match the following result from [extra-FEA_material](./extra-FEA_material.ipynb). _note: The scale factor is applied to displacements $\mathbf{u}$, not forces._

> __Note__: Look at the [extra FEA material](./extra-FEA_material). It
> has example code that you can plug in here to make these plots.
> Including background information and the source code for this plot
> below.

```

### 3. Determine cross-sectional area

a. Using aluminum, what is the minimum cross-sectional area to keep total y-deflections $<0.2~mm$?

b. Using steel, what is the minimum cross-sectional area to keep total y-deflections $<0.2~mm$?

c. What are the weights of the aluminum and steel trusses with the
chosen cross-sectional areas?
