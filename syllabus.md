## Course Description

This is a project-based introduction to computational mechanics. There are five
modules with exercises, homeworks, and final projects.  The overall goal of the
course is to frame engineering problems as computational methods. Once we
can communicate our engineering problems to Python code (or any other computer
language) we can use standard computational methods to solve those problems. 

We will work through five modules:
1. [CompMech01-Getting Started](module_01/README)
1. [CompMech02-Analyze-data](module_02/README)
1. [CompMech03-Initial Value Problems](module_03/README)
1. [CompMech04-Linear Algebra](module_04/README)
1. [CompMech05-Boundary Value Problems](module_05/README) **Bonus**

## Course Objectives

This course introduces students to computational methods in
[Python](https://www.python.org/).  The course introduces numerical
methods, best programming practices, and version control.
These methods will be applied to a number of physics-based problems.

## Course Expectations
Students are expected to create numerical approximations for linear and
nonlinear problems, understand approximations due to floating point operations
and numerical approaches and solve differential equations using numerical
differentiation and integration. Students are also expected to learn basics of
git version control, Python functions and programming best practices. 

Students are expected to work together, share resources, and build
collaboratively. Any work that is turned in by an individual should
reflect the student's understanding of the material. 

Students _should_ 
- copy/paste code from textbook, then read through it to understand
- post/share code examples and error messages 
- post/share code examples to resolve other students' issues
- submit work that they can explain

Students _should not_
- submit other students' work as their own
- submit work that they do not understand (copy-pasted without
reading/understanding)
