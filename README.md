Greetings!

Thanks for joining us for UConn's Computational Mechanics course.

Welcome to Computational Mechanics! 

This project is a collection of learning modules in engineering computations for
undergraduate students. These materials are a combination of work from [Prof.
Ryan C. Cooper](https://cooperrc.github.io) at the University of
Connecticut Mechanical Engineering Department and the [Engineering Computations
Modules](https://github.com/engineersCode/EngComp) from Prof. Lorena A. Barba
and doctoral student Natalia C. Clement at the George Washington University,
Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department. 

Each learning module is made up of three or four lessons, written as Jupyter
notebooks. We address an area of application or skills in computing in each
notebook and each module has an overall objective. We use Python as the
programming language.

The overall goal of the course is to frame engineering problems as
computational methods. Once we can communicate our engineering problems to
Python code (or any other computer language) we use standard
computational methods to solve those problems.
